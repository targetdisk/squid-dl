`squid-dl` is a massively parallel
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)-based YouTube downloader useful for
downloading large video playlists.  The faster your internet connection, the
more fun you can have!

## Installation
Run the `setup.py`, which will install `squid-dl` and its two dependencies:
`linode-cli` and `yt-dlp`.
```
$ python3 setup.py install
```

If that fails, you may have to install `setuptools`.  You can get it by
invoking:
```
$ python3 -m pip install setuptools
```

### Linode Proxy Setup
If you want to use the Linode SOCKS proxy feature, be sure to configure the
`linode-cli` first:
```
$ linode-cli configure --token
```

Follow the onscreen instructions and be sure to set sensible defaults.  The
default region for new Linodes that you pick here is where your proxies will
live.  For more information, see
[this page](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/linode-cli/) on Linode's website.

## Usage
To download a playlist, first fetch its metadata with `squidson`:
```
(.venv) $ squidson 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhI42_YpLVHvYqvjniSp7lhAM55K4fllO'
[youtube:tab] PLhI42_YpLVHvYqvjniSp7lhAM55K4fllO: Downloading webpage

[INFO]: Writing JSON-ified playlist info_dict to "Programming.json"
```

Now that you have the playlist `.json` file, you can download it with
`squid-dl`.  Use the `-n` flag to tell `squid-dl` how many workers you'd like to
spawn downloading videos at once (the default is 8 workers).  In this 12-video
playlist example, we'll spawn 12 workers:
```
(.venv) $ squid-dl -n 12 Programming.json

```

For more information see the built-in help by running `squid-dl -h`.

### SOCKS Proxying
For those with access to a dedicated SOCKS proxy already, you can use
`squid-dl`'s `-S` and a fully-qualified SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, or SOCKS5 proxy URL
to download your playlists through a proxy!  Here's an example using NordVPN's
SOCKS5 proxy:
```
(.venv) $ squid-dl -S socks5://us.socks.nordhold.net:1080 -n 12 Mems.json

[INFO]: Starting squid-dl...
[INFO]: saving videos to "Mems" directory
SOCKS username: 0asFVrZt0bw1ucPvQRKiUe87
SOCKS password:

[download] Download completed
[download] Download completed
[INFO]: Worker 1667352 done...
[INFO]: Worker 1667421 done...
[INFO]: All done!
```

You can also add a username and password to SOCKS5 and SOCKS4A proxy URLs in a
format like this:
```
socks5://username:password@hostname:port
```

**SECURITY NOTE:** typing in usernames and passwords this way is considered
insecure, as they will likely end up in your shell's history file completely
unprotected and in the clear (â˜¹).  It is generally recommended to input the
username and password interactively unless you are scripting `squid-dl`.

### Linode Proxying
With the `-L` option, you can run each worker through its own Linode-powered
SSH-tunneled SOCKSv5 proxy!  `squid-dl` will make an temporary SSH key in
the current working directory and then get to work spinning up Linodes and
downloading your videos:
```
(.venv) anon@fire-crotch:~/butter/youtube/btr$ squid-dl -L Mem.json
